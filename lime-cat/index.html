              <center><p>It's a beautiful Wendesday afternoon at about 3pm as I write this.
                I wanted to take a minute and write an Ode to the things around me.
                The things currently around me are in direct reflection of what my afternoon will be.
                 I am finishing up some home work and then I am
                 headed to the Cache Le Poudre river to meet a friend to do some fly fishing.
